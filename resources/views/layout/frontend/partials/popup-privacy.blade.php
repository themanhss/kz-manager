        <p>
            Your privacy is important to us and we are committed to handling your personal information in a responsible
            way in accordance with the Privacy Act. This is our Privacy Policy and it sets out how we collect, store,
            use and disclose your personal information. We recommend that you read it carefully.
        </p>
        <p>
            You do not have to provide us with your personal information, but if you do not do so we may not be able to
            provide you with our products or services, nor access to special offers. By visiting any of our websites,
            applying for, renewing or using any of our products or services, products or services we introduce to you,
            or providing us with your information for any purpose, you agree to your information being collected, held,
            used and disclosed as set out in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <h5>The information we collect</h5>
        <p>
            We collect the information necessary for us to provide you with products, services or access to special offers.
            We will only collect your sensitive information if you have provided us with consent to do so. Where practicable,
            we will give you the option of interacting with us anonymously.
        </p>
        <p>
            The information we collect and hold generally includes your name, address, date of birth, and contact details
            (such as your phone number, fax number and/or email address).
        </p>
        <p>
            However, we may also collect and hold other information required to provide products or services or assistance to you,
            including your gender, employment, details of your previous insurances, sensitive information (such as health
            information and criminal records), claims history, your personal assets and those of your spouse or partner.
        </p>
        <h5>How we collect your information</h5>
        <p>
            We may collect your information in various ways, including via telephone, our website, hard copy forms or email.
            Whenever you choose to deal with us directly, we will where possible, collect this information directly from you.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, there may be occasions when we collect your information from someone else. This may include your broker or
            financial adviser, our authorised representatives or Intermediaries, other insurers, employers, our distributors,
            agents or related entities, medical practitioners and rehabilitation providers, another party involved in a claim,
            investigators, family members, anyone you have authorised to deal with us on your behalf, and/or our advisors
            (including our legal advisors).
        </p>
        <p>
            On all occasions, your information is collected, held, used and disclosed by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
            We may also seek to collect information about someone else from you (for example, if you request a product or service
            jointly with another person). However, you must not provide us with information about another person unless you have
            clear consent from that person to do so and let them know about this Privacy Policy and where to find it.
        </p>
        <h5>How we use your information</h5>
        <p>
            We only use your information for the purpose for which it was provided to us, related purposes and as permitted by law.
            Such purposes include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>responding to your enquiries;</li>
            <li>

            <li>
                processing your survey or questionnaire responses for the purpose(s) notified in the survey or questionnaire (if you
                have chosen to participate in such);
            </li>
            <li>for market research so that we can better understand our customers' needs and tailor our future products and services accordingly;</li>
            <li>
                providing you with marketing information regarding other products and services (of ours or of a third party) which we
                believe may be of interest to you, if you have opted-in to receive such information;
            </li>
            <li>quality assurance and training purposes; and</li>
            <li>any other purposes identified at the time of collecting your information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            However, we will only use your sensitive information for the purposes for which it was initially collected,
            other directly related purposes or purposes to which you otherwise consent.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are not a customer (for example, if you are a medical practitioner, investigator, expert, claimant or other third party),
            your information will only be used for the specific purpose or claim for which it was provided to us, unless you have consented
            to other uses.
        </p>
        <h5>How we disclose your information</h5>
        <p>Where appropriate, we will disclose your information to our related entities and third parties who provide services to us or on our behalf, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>insurance advisers (such as Swann authorised representatives and insurance brokers);</li>
            <li>mailing houses;</li>
            <li>insurance reference bureaux, underwriters and re-insurers (and their representatives);</li>
            <li>other insurance providers;</li>
            <li>any credit providers that have security over your property;</li>
            <li>in the case of some claims (or likely claims), assessors, repairers, builders, investigators, your employer, medical practitioners, rehabilitation and other health providers;</li>
            <li>the external dispute resolution scheme we are a signatory to;</li>

            <li>government bodies, regulators, law enforcement agencies and any other parties where required by law; and</li>
            <li>our related entities so that they can also offer you products and services if you have opted-in to receive such information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We will only disclose your sensitive information for the purposes for which it was initially collected, other directly related
            purposes or purposes to which you otherwise consent.
        </p>
        <p>
            A small number of our related entities and third party service providers are or will be located in countries outside of Australia
            (mostly in New Zealand and in the United States). Our contracts with these parties generally include an obligation for them to
            comply with Australian privacy law and our Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, you acknowledge that, by agreeing to the disclosure of your information to these entities outside of Australia,
            we will no longer be required to take reasonable steps to ensure the overseas recipient's compliance with the Australian
            privacy law in relation to your information and we will not be liable to you for any breach of the Australian privacy
            law by these overseas recipients and, on this basis, you consent to such disclosure.
        </p>

        <p>It&rsquo;s still very important that you take some steps to help keep up security when you&rsquo;re online:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Protect your personal information, such as usernames, passwords and policy details, by not allowing anyone to see you entering them, and avoid public wi-fi usage.</li>

            <li>Don&rsquo;t let your browser save your password for our websites.</li>

        <h4>How do you make sure you&rsquo;re going to the right website?</h4>
        <ul>

        <h4>Keeping safe with email</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Never disclose personal, financial or debit/credit card information by email. <a href="mailto:Swann.Compliance@swanninsurance.com.au" class="blue">Contact us</a> if you&rsquo;re unsure of the legitimacy of any email that appears to have come from us.</li>
            <li>We will never ask for sensitive or personal information such as usernames, passwords or policy details if you haven’t asked for our help first.</li>
        </ul>
